				<p>I'm Ali Abbasimoghaddasi. It's my first Website which happened to be managed in my second semester at Langara college. I did this website which is based on some moderin information about cars. Personally, my favorite brand of cars is Toyota but in the website we face variety brands of cars. This project was a good chance for me to put more time on designing a page and website. Lastly, If you're interested in learning more about computer and web developing, I recommend taking 1030 course at Langara!<br><br>Here's my personal email in case you wanted to contct me and give comments<br><br>ali_sitrick@yahoo.com<br><br>Thank You.</p>
